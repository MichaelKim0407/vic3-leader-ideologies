# Victoria 3 mod: Leader Ideology Fixes

As this is a bugfix/balance mod, the mod content is different based on the game version.

You can find the mod under `src/` in each branch named after the game version.

All changes are specified in the commit history.
A one-change-per-commit policy is applied.
If you are familiar with git, you may play around with it and cherry-pick the changes you want.

Note that my editor removes all trailing whitespaces so if you compare with vanilla files you'll see whitespace diffs.
